Non-Technical Material Learned:

Technical Material Learned: A majority of websites are ordered or unordered lists in HTML. I was never aware of this. 

samsCats ["buddycat", "kitkat", "jojo", "pinky"]
samsCats.push('Meow Mix')
This will add Meow Mix to the array making the list total of 5 instead of 4.

samsDogs ["demi", "parker"]

var samsPets = ["samsCats", "samsDogs"]

Accessing inside arrays: samsPets[0][0] will produce: "buddycat"
