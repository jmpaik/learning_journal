Non-Technical Material Learned: None.

Technical Material Learned: I was able to debug my Salmon Project Cookie Project in regards to calculating totals. Apparently, I had a typo in my syntax and once I cleaned it up, the totals appeared. Last night I spent a nearly 30 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong. Stepping away from my code helped bring fresh eyes.
