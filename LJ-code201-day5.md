Non-Technical Material Learned: None.

Technical Material Learned: I am learning about DOM in Javascript. It is the first time I have ever seen coding at this depth. I was intimidated at first but that was because it's a lot of lines of code to write in this method. We are moving forward with Constructor Functions. It will help with making my lines of code dryer for the lab assignment. We are now making a sales table for a cookie stand as a prompt for the learning objective. Currently, I am having diffculty recalling data because I am inexperienced. I imagine this will improve as I tinker with different types of code. Overall, I don't expect to be a advanced developer overnight. I am surprised how far I have already come in just 7 days. My plan of action is now to catch up on some of my lab assignments.
