Non-Technical Material Learned: None.

Technical Material Learned: Today's topic of learning in regards to Forms was a particular interest to me. It appears to be the most applicable function in today's online world compared to the other lab exercises. Watching the live demo helped me understand how chat apps and websites like Yelp or Facebook operate under the hood. I hope to be a specialist in Forms code writing. I like the Forms concept in javascript because it interacts and has an impact with the user in the most practical and useful way. I'm curious if in the corporate world in software development if teams are built based on which part of the function they are in charge of maintaining/improving. It seems unrealisting to have employees work on every aspect of the enterprisal website on a daily basis. I can imagine that websites for smaller businesses would allow devs to have 360 degree access to the sites architecture.
