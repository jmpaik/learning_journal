Non-Technical Material Learned: My code for the Salmon Cookies project was very hairy. I did get help from my peers and that helped me understand what I was doing a bit more. I also discovered that the learning journals was going to be submitted every other day. This was one slipped through the cracks because I was confused and sick. Life goes on.

Technical Material Learned: None.
