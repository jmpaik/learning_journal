Michael's log 9/20/2016

Non-Technical Material Learned: I received my first lab assignment this afternoon. When I had read the directions, I was overwhelmed. I began to think I should quit the school. I spent some time asking myself why I felt defeated so quickly. The fear of failure seemed to be the root cause. I recalled earlier instruction that it was anticipated that I would begin to experience the imposter syndrome. These symptoms arrived sooner than I had expected. I treated myself to a cookie and realized life was not going to end. I realized I needed to fail in order to learn. The unknown became less intimidating. As I began piecing together my assignment I saw my progress. Oddly, this brought me joy in an unsual way...I started to feel hot and bothered in my pants because of my new found code writing skills.

Technical Material Learned: Today I learned a shortcut for my javascript code. This code is the shorter version: var answer1 = prompt('Is Michael a student in programming at Code Fellows?').toLowerCase();.

Where as I would have needed to write an additional line: answer1 = answer1.toLowerCase();
to do the same thing.

In other words, I can attach .toLowerCase(); to the end of my variable and eliminate the entire code line: answer1 = answer1.toLowerCase();.

I also learned how to commit and push. We also practiced in our Terminal to navigate our files and folders. I was also reminded on various keyboard shortcuts. I cannot list all of them because it would take too long to list them here.

Finally, I also learned the importance utilizing 'string' and not "string". Double quotes is not used by the industry. Single quotes are used by Google according to Frazier. I am curious to know why that is.

All in all, I am slowly getting comfortable using the tools and shortcuts as a programming student. I anticipate I will forget some things but will be able to recall them again as the week continues.
