<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 1</h1>

Michael's log 9/19/2016

Non-Technical Material Learned: Today, the first day of class, was less about coding but more about introducing how our emotion and mind will react to learning how to program. Our emotional reactions will swing from highs to lows. High emotions involve feelings of mastery while low emotions involve feelings of great defeat. This is all part of the process. It is normal. The more important take away from this lesson is to continue forward and accept mistakes as part of a terrific learning process. Our course evaluation is not entirely about result but rather a process of troubleshooting problems.

Techinical Material Learned: It was interesting to observe that inside the coding world there is great joy to not regress utilizing the almighty mouse pad. It is a techy-ego booster to keep away from the mouse. Hence, we learned how to use the command line in Bash and use key terms like 'mkdir', 'cd', or 'ls' to navigate inside files and folders. Suprisingly, I found this to be more efficient and precise. I started to take joy in not resorting to the mouse. We also got a demo of Github and Atom which seem to be primary tools we will use as developers. I must get comfortable with them shortly.
