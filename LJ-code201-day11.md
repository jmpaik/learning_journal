Non-Technical Material Learned: None.

Technical Material Learned: Today we peer programmed to get our Bus Mall storing locally and to clean up any bugs we encountered during this lab. This was very helpful. Ford was nice enough to correct some of my code with my broken click tracker. Also, we figured out that my table was not visually showing because my CSS had a background color of black and the table was printing black text. I wanted to slap myself in the face because I spent hours the night before trying to figure out why my code was not working. The code worked. It was just CSS. Hated life at this point. I asked Ford to slap my face. He laughed. He didn't slap my face but he was tempted.
